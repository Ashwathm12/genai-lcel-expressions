 ## Design and Implementation of LangChain Expression Language (LCEL) Expressions

### AIM:
To design and implement a LangChain Expression Language (LCEL) expression that utilizes at least two prompt parameters and three key components (prompt, model, and output parser), and to evaluate its functionality by analyzing relevant examples of its application in real-world scenarios.

### PROBLEM STATEMENT:
Develop an LCEL-based application to process expressions with dynamic parameters, leveraging a prompt template for structured interaction, a language model to process the input, and an output parser for extracting meaningful results.

### DESIGN STEPS:

#### STEP 1:
Create a prompt template with placeholders for at least two parameters.
#### STEP 2:
Use LangChain's language model to process the prompt and generate a response.
#### STEP 3:
Implement an output parser to extract structured results from the model's response.
